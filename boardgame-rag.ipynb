(a) during the game each player, having made the move on\\nthe chessboard, shall stop the clock controlling the player’s time\\nand start the opponent’s clock. a player must always be allowed to\\nstop the clock. the move is not considered to have been completed\\nuntil he has done so, unless the made move ends the game. (see\\narticles 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3)\\nthe time between making the move on the chessboard and stop-\\nping the clock and starting the opponent’s clock is regarded as part\\nof the time allotted to the player.\\n(b) a player must stop the clock with the same hand as that with\\nwhich he made the move. it is forbidden for either player to obstruct\\nthe access of the opponent to the clock.', '---  ---\\nthe official rules of chess  cardoza publishing\\n(c) the players must handle the chess clock gently. it is forbid-\\nden to punch it forcibly, to pick it up or to knock it over. improper\\nclock handling shall be penalized in accordance with article 13.4.\\n6.8. expiration of the time control occurs when the arbiter ob-\\nserves the fact or when a valid claim to that effect has been made by\\neither player.\\n6.9. except where articles 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 apply, if a player does\\nnot complete the prescribed number of moves in the allotted time,\\nthe game is lost by the player. however, the game is drawn, if the\\nposition is such that the opponent cannot checkmate the player by\\nany possible series of legal moves.\\n6.10. every indication given by the clocks is considered to be\\nconclusive in the absence of any evident defect. a chess clock with\\nan evident defect shall be replaced. the arbiter shall use best judg-\\nment when determining the times to be shown on the replacement\\nchess clock.\\n6.11. if the clock in use allows both expiration of time on both\\nsides, and it is impossible to establish which player’s time expired\\nfirst, the game shall continue.\\n6.12. (a) if the game needs to be interrupted, the arbiter shall\\nstop the clocks.\\n(b) a player may stop the clocks in order to seek the arbiter’s\\nassistance.\\n(c) the arbiter shall decide when the game is to be restarted.\\n6.13. if an irregularity occurs and/or the pieces have to be re-\\nstored to a previous position, the arbiter shall determine the times to\\nbe shown on the clocks, using the best evidence at available.\\n6.14. devices and displays showing the current position on the\\nchessboard, the moves and the number of moves made, and clocks\\nwhich also show the number of moves, are allowed in the playing\\nhall. however, these devices are not to be considered conclusive\\nevidence in support of any claim, and remain at all times unofficial.\\narticle 7: illegal positions\\n7.1. (a) if during a game it is found that the initial position of the\\npieces was incorrect, the game shall be canceled and a new game\\nplayed.\\n(b) if during a game it is found that the only error is that the\\nchessboard has been placed contrary to article 2.1, the game con-', '---  ---\\nthe official rules of chess  cardoza publishing\\ntinues but the position reached must be transferred to a correctly\\nplaced chessboard.\\n7.2. if a game has begun with colors reversed then it shall con-\\ntinue, unless the arbiter rules otherwise.\\n7.3. if a player displaces one or more pieces, that player shall\\nre-establish the correct position while the player’s clock is running. if\\nnecessary the opponent has the right to restart the player’s clock\\nwithout making a move in order to make sure the player re-estab-\\nlishes the correct position on his or her own time.\\n7.4. if during a game it is found that an illegal move has been\\nmade, or that pieces have been displaced from their squares, the\\nposition before the irregularity shall be re-instated. if the position\\nimmediately before the irregularity cannot be identified, the game\\nshall continue from the last identifiable position prior to the irregular-\\nity. the clocks shall be adjusted according to article 6.13 and, in the\\ncase of an illegal move, article 4.3 applies to the move replacing the\\nillegal move. the game shall then continue.\\narticle 8: the recording of the moves\\n8.1. in the course of play each player is required to record all\\nmoves by both players, move after move, as clearly and legibly as\\npossible, in the algebraic notation (appendix e), on the scoresheet\\nprescribed for the competition.\\na player may reply to the opponent’s move before recording it,\\nbut must record that move before making a reply to the opponent’s\\nnext move.. the offer of a draw must be recorded on the scoresheet\\nby both players.(appendix e.12) if a player due to physical or reli-\\ngious reasons, is unable to keep score, an amount of time, decided\\nby the arbiter, shall be deducted from the allotted time at the begin-\\nning of the game, and an assistant may be supplied to record the\\ngame.\\n8.2. the entire scoresheet shall be made available to the arbiter\\nat any time.\\n8.3. the scoresheets are the exclusive property of the organiz-\\ners of the event.\\n8.4. if a player has less than five minutes left on the clock and\\ndoes not have additional time of 30 seconds or more added with\\neach move, then the player is not obliged to meet the requirements\\nof article 8.1. immediately after one side’s time has expired the player', '---  ---\\nthe official rules of chess  cardoza publishing\\nmust update the scoresheet completely.\\n8.5. (a) if neither player is required to keep score under article\\n8.4, the arbiter or an assistant should attempt to keep score. in this\\ncase, immediately after one flag has fallen, the arbiter shall stop the\\nclocks. then both players shall update their scoresheets, using the\\narbiter’s or the opponent’s scoresheet.\\n(b) if only one player is not required to keep score under article\\n8.4, that player must update the scoresheet completely as soon as\\ntime has expired in any given time control. provided it is the player’s\\nmove, access to opponent’s scoresheet is permitted upon request.\\nthe player is not permitted to move until after he has completed the\\nscoresheet and returned the opponent’s, if it was consulted.\\n(c) if no complete scoresheet is available, the players must re-\\nconstruct the game on a second chessboard under the control of\\nthe arbiter or an assistant, who shall first record the actual game\\nposition before reconstruction takes place. notation recorded by\\ndemonstration devices may be used to help with the reconstruction.\\n8.6. if the scoresheets cannot be brought up to date showing\\nthat a player has overstepped the allotted time, the next move made\\nshall be considered as the first of the following time period, unless\\nthere is evidence that more moves have been made.\\narticle 9: the drawn game\\n9.1. a player can propose a draw after making a move on the\\nchessboard. this must be done before stopping the clock and start-\\ning the opponent’s clock. an offer at any other time during play is still\\nvalid, but article 12.5 must be considered. no conditions can be\\nattached to the offer. in both cases the offer cannot be withdrawn\\nand remains valid until the opponent accepts it, rejects it orally, re-\\njects it by making a move, or the game is concluded in some other\\nway.\\nthe offer may be made either orally or by means of a device\\n(see 9.7). oral offers may be made by any reasonable means which\\nclearly indicate the offer, for example:\\n[i]\\n“i offer you a draw”\\n[ii] “would you like a draw?”\\n[iii] “draw?”\\n[iv] “remis?” (pronounced ray-mee)\\n[v] “nichya?” (pronounced nee-chya)', '---  ---\\nthe official rules of chess  cardoza publishing\\nthe offer of a draw shall be noted by each player on the\\nscoresheet with the symbol (=).\\n9.2. the game is drawn, upon a correct claim by the player hav-\\ning the move, when the same position, for at least the third time (not\\nnecessarily by repetition of moves)...\\n(a) is about to appear, if the player first writes the move on the\\nscoresheet and declares to the arbiter the intention to make this\\nmove.\\n(b) has just appeared.\\npositions as in (a) and (b) are considered the same, if the same\\nplayer has the move, pieces of the same kind and color occupy the\\nsame squares, and the possible moves of all the pieces of both play-\\ners are the same. positions are not the same if a pawn could have\\nbeen captured en passant or if the right to castle immediately or in\\nthe future has been changed.\\n9.3. the game is drawn, upon a correct claim by the player hav-\\ning the move, if\\n(a) the player writes on the scoresheet, and declares to the arbi-\\nter the intention to make a move which shall result in the last 50\\nmoves having been made by each player without the movement of\\nany pawn and without the capture of any piece, or\\n(b) the last 50 consecutive moves have been made by each player\\nwithout the movement of any pawn and without the capture of any\\npiece.\\n9.4. if the player makes a move without having claimed the draw,\\nthe right to claim a draw on that move per article 9.2 or 9.3, is lost.\\n9.5. if a player claims a draw as in article 9.2 or 9.3 the player\\nshall immediately stop both clocks. the player is not allowed to with-\\ndraw the claim.\\n(a) if the claim is found to be correct the game is immediately\\ndrawn.\\n(b) if the claim is found to be incorrect, the arbiter shall deduct\\nhalf of the claimant’s remaining time up to a maximum of three min-\\nutes and add three minutes to the opponent’s remaining time. then\\nthe game shall continue and the intended move must be made.\\n9.6. the game is drawn when a position is reached from which a\\ncheckmate cannot occur by any possible series of legal moves, even\\nwith the most unskilled play (except as per article 10, where appli-\\ncable). this immediately ends the game.', '---  ---\\nthe official rules of chess  cardoza publishing\\n9.7 a draw flag may be used to offer a draw. a draw

clocks and summon the arbiter.\\n(a) if the arbiter is satisfied the opponent is making no effort to\\nwin the game by normal means, or that it is not possible to win by\\nnormal means, then he shall declare the game drawn. otherwise he\\nshall postpone the decision.\\n(b) if the arbiter postpones the decision, the opponent may be\\nawarded two extra minutes thinking time and the game shall con-\\ntinue in the presence of the arbiter.\\n(c) having postponed the decision, the arbiter may subsequently\\ndeclare the game drawn, even after time has expired on one player’s\\nclock.\\n10.3. illegal moves do not necessarily lose. after the action taken\\nunder article 7.4, for a first illegal move by a player, the arbiter shall\\ngive two minutes extra time to the opponent; for a second illegal\\nmove by the same player, the arbiter shall give another two minutes\\nextra time to the opponent; for a third illegal move by the same player,\\nthe arbiter shall declare the game lost by the player who played\\nincorrectly.\\n10.4. if the clock shows that time has expired for both players\\nand it is impossible to establish which flag fell first, the game is drawn.\\narticle 11:

first letter of the name which is\\ncommonly used in their own country. in printed matter, iconic repre-\\nsentations of the pieces are often used instead of letters, but draw-\\nings of pieces may not be used by players when notating a game.\\ne3. pawns are not indicated by their first letter, but are recog-\\nnized by the absence of such a letter.\\ne4. the eight files (from left to right for white and from right to\\nleft for black) are indicated by the letters, a, b, c, d, e, f, g and h,\\nrespectively. lower case is preferred.\\ne5. the eight ranks (from bottom to top for white and from top to\\nbottom for black) are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, respectively.\\nin the initial position the white pieces and pawns are placed on the\\nfirst and second ranks; the black pieces and pawns on the eighth\\nand seventh ranks.\\ne6. each of the sixty four squares is therefore indicated by a\\nunique combination of a letter and a number.\\ne7. each move of a piece is indicated by (a)

the\\nfirst letter of the name of the piece in question and the square of\\narrival. when a pawn makes a capture, not only the square of arrival\\nbut also the file of departure must be indicated, followed by an x. in\\nthe case of an “en passant” capture, the square of arrival is given as\\nthe square on which the capturing pawn finally rests.\\ne9. if two identical pieces can move to the same square, the\\npiece that is moved is indicated as follows:\\n(1) if both pieces are on the same rank: by the first letter of the\\nname of the piece, the rank of the square of departure, and the\\nsquare of arrival.\\n(2) if both pieces are on the same file: by the first letter of the\\nname of the piece, the rank of the square of departure, and the\\nsquare of arrival.\\n(3) if the pieces are on different ranks and files, method (1) is\\npreferred. in the case of capture, an x must be inserted before the\\nsquare of arrival.\\ne10. if two pawns can capture the same piece or pawn of the\\nopponent, the pawn that is moved is indicated by the letter of the file\\nof departure, an x, the square of arrival', '---  ---\\nthe official rules of chess  cardoza publishing\\ne11. special moves\\nin the case of a pawn promotion, the actual pawn move is indi-\\ncated, followed immediately by the first letter of the new piece. en\\npassant captures require no special

sign (+). checkmate is indicated by\\nthe symbol #.\\ne12. the offer of a draw is indicated by an equal sign (=).\\nchess equipment\\nchess sets and boards\\nthe preferred chess set has the following specifications:\\na board with squares 5 cm. x 5 cm. for scholastic events, coor-\\ndinates (a-h, 1-8) should be imprinted on the edges of the board.\\nthe pawn should have a base with a width equal to one half the\\nsize of the square. four pawns should fit in the area of one square.\\nlying on its side diagonally on a square, the height of the rook should\\nbe equal to the diagonal of the square.\\nthe size of the bishop and knight vary from equal to the height\\nof the rook, to a sharply ascending height. the king is the tallest\\npiece, though the queen may be quite close in height.\\nthe shape of the pieces should correspond to the staunton de-\\nsign:\\nin tournaments where players supply their own equipment, the\\narbiter decides which of the chess sets is closer in design to the\\npreferred set described above.', '---  ---\\nthe official rules of chess  cardoza publishing\\nchess clocks\\na chess clock is a timing device which has two timers, one for\\neach player, arranged in such a way that if one player’s clock is in\\nmotion, the other is not. it is typically a digital device (analog clocks\\nare rapidly disappearing and cannot be used for many modern time\\ncontrols) which can be programmed by the user in a wide variety of\\nways to impose time limits on the game. whatever time control is\\nused, the clock should stop in the event that a player exceeds the\\ntime limit and some method of indicating the expiration, such as\\nflashing the digits, signals to players, arbiters and spectators that\\nthe time has expired.\\nthe scoresheet\\nthe scoresheet is an important part of tournament play. the large\\nchess databases of tournament games grow because the recording\\nof games is obligatory at chess tournaments. when the organizers\\nprovide scoresheets, these are considered property of the tourna-\\nment. the scoresheet, which is often customized for a major tourna-\\nment, especially if sponsored, allows the player to record the follow-\\ning:\\nthe name of the tournament.\\ndate of the game.\\nround of the tournament.\\nboard number assigned to the game.\\nname of each player.\\noptionally, the rating and team of each player.\\nall the moves of the game.\\noptionally, the time for each move.']\n"
